# Eric Yang
Hello. I am Eric, an interdisciplinary technology + media student researching
user psychology, communications, and design. I use my understanding of human behavior
and computers to solve design problems.

#### About Me
I focus on analyzing and designing interactive systems that bridge technology, behavior, and media. My work spans user research, game-based learning, and digital experiences, with an emphasis on how people engage with interactive environments. I enjoy creating small prototypes and visual diagrams to guide people through understanding.

# Projects

#### Geolocation RPG
Collaborate with a research team including a professor of Health Education and a consulting psychiatrist to develop a novel framework for gamifying holistic well-being.
