        <!-- Overview -->
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Geolocation RPG is a location-tracking game inspired by Dungeons and Dragons that
          encourages players to move through real-world spaces while engaging with narrative,
          choice, and character progression. The project explores how location-based mechanics
          can support physical, mental, and spiritual well-being rather than just reward
          grinding or time spent in-app.
        </p>

        <!-- Context & Goals -->
        <h2>Context & Goals</h2>
        <p>
          This project sits at the intersection of game design, user psychology, and media
          studies. The primary goal is to understand how geolocation mechanics and narrative
          structure can:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Motivate players to explore their surroundings in meaningful ways,</li>
          <li>Encourage reflection and intentional play rather than compulsive checking, and</li>
          <li>Support different dimensions of well-being through quests and story events.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Design questions guiding the project include how far we can push tabletop-style
          roleplaying and decision-making into a location-based format without overwhelming
          players or turning the experience into pure grind.
        </p>

        <!-- Core Design -->
        <h2>Core Design</h2>
        <p>
          The game is structured around a node-based map of locations, each tied to
          quests, encounters, or story beats. Players move between nodes in the real world
          and unlock:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Story encounters</strong> – choices and dialog with consequences for future events,
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Check-in tasks</strong> – short reflective or activity-based prompts (e.g., journaling, observation),
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Class and character progression</strong> – light RPG-style upgrades tied to play style rather than
            raw grinding.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The system borrows from tabletop RPGs (D&amp;D-style roles and narrative branching) while
          remaining lightweight enough to be used in everyday life.
        </p>

        <!-- Mechanics & Structure -->
        <h2>Game Mechanics & Structure</h2>
        <p>
          The early prototype focuses on a small region with a limited set of nodes, each
          representing a type of space (e.g., quiet study areas, walking paths, social spaces).
          Mechanics include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Location-triggered events:</strong> reaching a node unlocks a new scene, quest, or prompt.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dice-influenced outcomes:</strong> light dice-based resolution for certain choices, echoing tabletop
            roleplay.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Non-linear progression:</strong> players can choose different paths and revisit locations with new
            context or story branches.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Rather than focusing on win conditions, the design emphasizes reflective play and
          a sense of ongoing journey.
        </p>

        <!-- Research Approach -->
        <h2>Research Approach</h2>
        <p>
          The project is designed to support mixed methods research on how players interact
          with geolocation-based systems. Planned and ongoing work includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Qualitative feedback:</strong> interviews and open-ended responses about motivation, friction, and
            perceived value.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Behavioral data:</strong> patterns of movement, node visitation, and quest completion over time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Experience sampling:</strong> short check-ins at key moments to capture mood and engagement in context.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The aim is to connect visible player behavior (where they go and what they do) with
          self-reported experience and perceived impact on well-being.
        </p>

        <!-- Process -->
        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>
          The current state of the project has gone through several phases:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Concept &amp; system sketching:</strong> defining the core loop, the structure of nodes, and
            how tabletop-style decision-making could map onto GPS-based movement.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Narrative and quest design:</strong> outlining small scenarios that fit into daily movement patterns
            (campus, neighborhood, commute) rather than requiring special trips.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Prototype documentation:</strong> building design documents and flow diagrams to support future
            digital implementations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Early playtesting plans:</strong> preparing small-scale tests to validate whether the structure
            feels engaging without being burdensome.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <!-- Tools & Contributions -->
        <h2>Tools & Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>
          My contributions to Geolocation RPG include:

        <ul>
          <li>Designing the core game loop and node/region structure,</li>
          <li>Drafting quests, events, and reflective prompts for different location types,</li>
          <li>Documenting rules, flows, and system behavior for future implementation, and</li>
          <li>Defining an initial research plan for evaluating engagement and well-being outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Tools used include digital documentation and mapping tools for structuring regions and
          nodes, along with standard design and note-taking software for iteration.
        </p>

        <!-- Status / Next Steps -->
        <h2>Status & Next Steps</h2>
        <p>
          The project is currently in the documented prototype stage, with system rules, narrative
          beats, and node structures outlined. Next steps include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Building a small digital or hybrid prototype to test with a limited group of players,</li>
          <li>Collecting initial feedback on usability, motivation, and narrative clarity, and</li>
          <li>Refining mechanics based on real-world play and movement patterns.</li>
        </ul>
