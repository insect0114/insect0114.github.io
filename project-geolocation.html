        <!-- Overview -->
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Geolocation RPG is a location-tracking game inspired by Dungeons and Dragons that
          encourages players to move through real-world spaces while engaging with narrative,
          choice, and character progression. The project explores how location-based mechanics
          and ethical storytelling can support physical, mental, and spiritual well-being.
        </p>

        <!-- Context & Goals -->
        <h2>Context & Goals</h2>
        <p>
          This project sits at the intersection of game design, user psychology, and media
          studies. The primary goal is to understand how geolocation mechanics and narrative
          structure can:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Encourage players to explore their surroundings in meaningful ways,</li>
          <li>Motivate play through implicit rewards rather than explicit rewards, and</li>
          <li>Support different dimensions of well-being through quests and story events.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Design questions guiding the project include how far we can push tabletop-style
          roleplaying and decision-making into a location-based format without overwhelming
          players or turning the experience into pure grind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Design questions guiding the project include how far we can push tabletop-style
          roleplaying and decision-making into a location-based format without overwhelming
          players and ensuring that the game can be played regardless of where people live.
        </p>

        <!-- Core Design -->
        <h2>Core Design</h2>
        <p>
          The game is structured around a node-based map of locations, each tied to
          quests, encounters, or story beats. Players move between nodes in the real world
          and unlock:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Story encounters</strong> – spiritually enrichening choices and dialog,
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Combat mechanics</strong> – enemy encounters that are fun and engaging,
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Class and character progression</strong> – light RPG-style upgrades suitable for both casual and competitive players.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The system borrows from tabletop RPGs (D&amp;D-style roles and narrative branching) while
          remaining lightweight enough to be used in everyday life.
        </p>

        <!-- Process -->
        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>
          The current state of the project has gone through several phases:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Concept &amp; system sketching:</strong> defining the core loop, the structure of nodes, and
            how tabletop-style decision-making could map onto GPS-based movement.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Narrative and quest design:</strong> outlining small scenarios that fit into daily movement patterns
            (campus, neighborhood, commute) rather than requiring special trips.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Prototype documentation:</strong> building design documents and flow diagrams to support future
            digital implementations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Early playtesting plans:</strong> preparing small-scale tests to validate whether the structure
            feels engaging without being burdensome.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <!-- Tools & Contributions -->
        <h2>Tools & Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>
          My contributions to Geolocation RPG include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Designing the core game loop and node/region structure,</li>
          <li>Drafting quests, events, and reflective prompts for different location types,</li>
          <li>Documenting rules, flows, and system behavior for future implementation,</li>
          <li>Prototyping combat mechanics and node systems using Python, and</li>
          <li>Defining an initial research plan for evaluating engagement and well-being outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Tools used include digital documentation and mapping tools for structuring regions and
          nodes, along with standard design and note-taking software for iteration.
        </p>

        <!-- Status / Next Steps -->
        <h2>Status & Next Steps</h2>
        <p>
          The project is currently in the documented prototype stage, with system rules, narrative
          beats, and node structures outlined. Next steps include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Building a small digital or hybrid prototype to test with a limited group of players,</li>
          <li>Collecting initial feedback on usability, motivation, and narrative clarity, and</li>
          <li>Refining mechanics based on real-world play and movement patterns.</li>
        </ul>
