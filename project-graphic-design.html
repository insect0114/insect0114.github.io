        <!-- Overview -->
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This project focuses on designing, producing, and managing physical merchandise using
          digital workflows. It combines vector-based graphic design with CNC-ready file
          preparation, vendor coordination, and basic operations management to run a small, game-
          adjacent merch line.
        </p>
        <p>
          The work sits at the intersection of design, fabrication, and logistics: turning ideas
          into production-ready files, collaborating with manufacturers, and ensuring the final
          products are consistent, durable, and aligned with the intended aesthetic.
        </p>

        <!-- Goals & Constraints -->
        <h2>Goals & Constraints</h2>
        <p>
          Key goals for the project include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Creating visually clear and appealing designs that survive physical production,</li>
          <li>Ensuring files are accurate for CNC cutting and layered manufacturing,</li>
          <li>Keeping costs, turnaround times, and minimum order quantities manageable, and</li>
          <li>Maintaining a consistent “brand feel” across multiple items.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Practical constraints such as kerf tolerances, material thickness, shipping costs, and
          vendor capabilities heavily influence both design and decision-making.
        </p>

        <!-- Design Workflow -->
        <h2>Design Workflow</h2>
        <p>
          The design process starts digitally and moves toward fabrication-ready assets. Typical
          workflow:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Concept sketching:</strong> rough visual ideas and references based on game aesthetics,
            characters, or motifs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Vector illustration:</strong> recreating and refining concepts in vector form for clean scaling,
            color separation, and precise outlines.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Production preparation:</strong> separating art into layers, assigning stroke/line types for
            cutting vs. engraving, and ensuring paths are closed and manufacturable.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mockups and revisions:</strong> generating digital mockups to visualize final products and
            iterating based on feedback or constraints.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Careful line weight, spacing, and shape decisions are required so that small details
          remain legible after cutting, printing, or layering.
        </p>

        <!-- CNC & File Preparation -->
        <h2>CNC & File Preparation</h2>
        <p>
          Since the project relies on CNC-style processes and layered acrylic or similar materials,
          files must be prepared with fabrication in mind:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Defining cut paths, engrave areas, and registration marks in separate layers,
          </li>
          <li>
            Adjusting designs for kerf (material removed by the cutting tool) and tolerances so
            that pieces fit together cleanly,
          </li>
          <li>
            Exporting in vendor-compatible formats (e.g., SVG, AI, or DXF) with clear color coding
            and naming conventions, and
          </li>
          <li>
            Documenting dimensions and layer order for consistent replication.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This step translates aesthetic decisions into precise technical instructions a machine
          and vendor can follow.
        </p>

        <!-- Operations & Management -->
        <h2>Operations & Management</h2>
        <p>
          Beyond design, the project also involves managing the small-scale operations required to
          get merchandise produced and into people’s hands. This includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Communicating with vendors about specs, limitations, and sample runs,</li>
          <li>Comparing pricing, minimum order quantities, and shipping options,</li>
          <li>Tracking orders, timelines, and quality issues, and</li>
          <li>Planning which designs are viable to produce within budget and time constraints.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This management layer is where design, economics, and logistics meet, and decisions here
          directly affect what can realistically be offered.
        </p>

        <!-- Brand & Visual Consistency -->
        <h2>Brand & Visual Consistency</h2>
        <p>
          A recurring focus of the work is maintaining a coherent visual identity across items.
          Even when designs are inspired by different games or references, they are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Aligned in terms of color usage and contrast,</li>
          <li>Structured with similar line language and shape language, and</li>
          <li>Presented in a way that feels part of the same collection.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This consistency helps pieces feel like they belong to a single designer and brand, not
          just a random assortment of items.
        </p>

        <!-- My Contributions -->
        <h2>My Contributions</h2>
        <p>
          In this project, my responsibilities include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Designing vector artwork and preparing CNC-compatible files,</li>
          <li>Defining layer structures, cut lines, and tolerances for production,</li>
          <li>Communicating with vendors and iterating based on samples or feedback, and</li>
          <li>Organizing the pipeline from initial concept to final manufactured piece.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This work blends creative decision-making with very practical, constraint-driven
          problem-solving.
        </p>

        <!-- Status & Future Work -->
        <h2>Status & Future Work</h2>
        <p>
          The project has resulted in a small but growing collection of merch designs that are
          ready for or already in production. Future directions include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Expanding the product line with new designs and form factors,</li>
          <li>Refining file standards and templates to speed up new item creation, and</li>
          <li>Connecting the merch more directly with interactive or game-based projects.</li>
        </ul>
